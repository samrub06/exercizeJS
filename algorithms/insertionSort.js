/**
 * Insertion Sort Algorithm
 * 
 * This function implements the insertion sort algorithm which builds the final sorted array
 * one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms
 * such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(nÂ²) - worst and average case
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - in-place sorting
 * 
 * @param {Array} arr - The array to be sorted
 * @returns {Array} - The sorted array
